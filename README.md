## 1. Project Description

This project sets up a custom Team Fortress 2 (TF2) server with integrated bot and plugin support, laying the groundwork for future reinforcement learning experiments. While the reinforcement learning component is still in development, the project provides a solid foundation for managing TF2 environments, automating server deployment, and testing AI interactions in-game.

**Abstract:**  
Developed a TF2 server automation tool that simplifies server setup, plugin integration, and bot management, reducing manual configuration and improving efficiency.
