# Milestones

### 1. Research necessary languages and proprietary software

The first major milestone will be researching the necessary languages and software required for this project to come together. As of now that includes SourcePawn, Deep RL, RCBot 2, and the Valve Developer SDK.

### 2. Set up local bot server and RCBot 2 compatibility

Using the Valve SDK, I will test and host a commandless bot in a local server and implement RCBot 2 functionality.

### 3. Create and link Python framework to RCBot 2

Once RCBot 2 is properly implemented within the game environment, I will then link and test commands sent from a Python environment to the bot within the game environment.

### 4. Implement and test SWISSBOT on simple task

At this milestone, I should have successfully utilized and tweaked Deep RL to successfully send autonomous commands based upon the bot's environment data via RCBot 2.

### 5. Create efficient storage method for training data and execution

By this milestone, should there be a need to store training data to reset a machine-learning platform to a clean slate, I will have implemented a way to export the training data as well as implementing a way to insert already established training data to the bots.

### 6. Expand testing environments for more complex testing

The bots should be able to learn how to do simple commands such as jumping and moving, by now I will have introduced more complex tasks for the bots to learn and train from. This will be done by creating new and robust testing environments and giving the bots targets to fire at.

### 7. Implement and test SWISSBOT on complex tasks

Limit test the capabilities of the bots by giving them difficult tasks such as shooting an enemy out of the air or navigating a complex obstacle course.

### 8. Test and repeat SWISSBOT against proprietary bots

I will have successfully trained my bot to play and win a standard match of Team Fortress 2 by having a team of 12 SWISSBOTs fight a team of 12 proprietary Team Fortress 2 bots.

### 9. Record inputs, screenshots, and footage for presentation

Capture necessary data and footage of games for presentation preparation.
