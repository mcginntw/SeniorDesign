# USER STORIES

As a player, I want to play against a challenging and life-like opponent so I can improve my skills.

As a server administrator, I want to provide my players with a challenging alternative to the standard gameplay loop so the players have fun and server retention increases.

As a game theorist, I want to determine the optimal way to play and navigate this game so I can implement common player decision-making in my own projects.
