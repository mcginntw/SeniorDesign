# Project Tasks

1. Research SourcePawn, RCBot 2 commands, DeepRL documentation and the Valve Developer SDK to further understand environments.
2. Set up local bot hosting server to enable quarantined testing environment.
3. Verify RCBot 2 input on bots to send inputs via Python code.
4. Create testing milestones and appropriate testing map via Hammer Editor to give the bots an environment to train and learn.
5. Start coding Python environment to send input to RCBot 2.
6. Design reward system to give incentive for bots' actions.
7. Begin implementing Deep RL logic to bot inputs.
8. Add code to display a graph of the bots' gradual progress towards a reward based on input data.
9. Add code to store data results efficiently (needs data structure).
10. Implement error codes and handling in case of unauthorized inputs.
11. Link the updated Python instance to RCBot 2 to test the AI.
12. Begin training bots based on simple reward (Standing on an objective).
13. Design a way to save training data on objective-based gameplay.
14. Begin training bots based on complex reward (Shooting an enemy)
15. Combine completed training data
16. Test bots against a team of enemy proprietary computer-players.
