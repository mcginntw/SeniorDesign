## About

SWISSBOT is a concept to develop autonomous, machine-learning taught bots for Team Fortress 2. Using Python for reinforcement learning and SourcePawn for game integration, this framework would allow for movement, combat, and objectives via controlled in-game tests. The goal is to create skilled AI opponents that emulate human player behavior in competitive environments.
